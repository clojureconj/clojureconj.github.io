<p>This course is intended for new Clojure developers with some programming experience in another language. Sessions will include a mixture of lecture and hands-on guided labs.</p>

								<header><h2><a name="check">Property-based Testing With test.check</a></h2></header>

<p><strong>Dates: November 15th, 3 pm - 5 pm (2 hrs)<br>
	Instructor: Gary Fredericks (<a href="http://twitter.com/gfredericks_">@gfredericks_</a>)<br>
        Price: $150</strong></p>

<p>test.check is a Clojure property-based testing tool inspired by QuickCheck. The core idea of test.check is that instead of enumerating expected input and output for unit tests, you write properties about your functions that should hold true for all inputs. This workshop will cover the use of data generators to create random input data, the definition of properties, how shrinking works, and advanced property modeling techniques.</p>
